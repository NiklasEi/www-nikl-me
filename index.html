    <p class="is-centered">I study Pysics (actually just finished) and in my free time I like to program. This website acts as a portfolio containing some of my projects. Apart from that there is a small <a href="{{ '/blog' | relative_url }}">Blog</a> and <a href="{{ '/travelling' | relative_url }}">images from travelling</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="is-centered">Here you can find, for example, <a href="{{ '/projects/minecraft/' | relative_url }}">a few Minecraft plugins</a> that are published on <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/nikl.205362/" target="_blank">Spigot</a>. At the moment I am working on <a href="{{ '/projects/hytale/' | relative_url }}">projects</a> concerning the upcoming game <a href="https://hytale.com/" target="_blank">Hytale</a>. Most of these are open source and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/NiklasEi" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
