    <h2 class="is-centered">Hi, I'am Niklas</h2>
    <h4 class="is-centered">and this is my spot on the internet</h4>
    <br><br>
    <p class="is-centered">I studied Pysics and learned programming in my free time and several jobs during my studies. Beginning of 2020 I started working as a Software Consultant. This website acts as a portfolio containing some of my personal projects. Apart from that there is a small <a href="{{ '/blog' | relative_url }}">Blog</a> and <a href="{{ '/travelling' | relative_url }}">images from travelling</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="is-centered">Here you can find, for example, <a href="{{ '/projects/minecraft/' | relative_url }}">a few Minecraft plugins</a> that are published on <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/nikl.205362/" target="_blank">Spigot</a>. At the moment I am working on <a href="{{ '/projects/hytale/' | relative_url }}">projects</a> concerning the upcoming game <a href="https://hytale.com/" target="_blank">Hytale</a>. Most of these are open source and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/NiklasEi" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="is-centered">At the moment I spend a lot of my free time writing a puzzle app with Flutter and learning Rust. During work hours I am mainly working on Microservices using NodeJS and (some) Kotlin.</p>
