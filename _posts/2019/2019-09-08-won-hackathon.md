title: "My first Hackathon - my team won"

I attended [Proof of Moin](https://www.pom-hack.org/){: target="_blank"} in Hamburg, a hackathon themed "Blockchain". It ended today and I was positively surprised by what my team of four managed to do in 2 days. With two developers and a managing team of two we wrote a Dapp on the [EVAN network](https://evan.network/){: target="_blank"} to manage planes after production. Meaning we are using the blockchain as a temperproof store for plane/flight data and status controll for plane parts.

Our app is called "Deadalus" and won both, the first price of the hackathon and the technology price from EVAN networks.

Take a look at [the code](https://github.com/pom-2019/aviation-dapp){: target="_blank"} if you like :)
