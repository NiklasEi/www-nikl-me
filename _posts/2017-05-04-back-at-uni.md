I've been back in germany for a few weeks now and I already had itchy feet a few days in. Thinking about the last years I would like to go to a different continent then Asia for a change. Middle America or South America sound pretty good. I've also always wanted to visit Kanada and Alaska. Maybe it is time for some cold countries...

This semester is a rather empty one concerning lectures. I am prolonging my masters with an erasmus semester in Krakow and there are almost no credit points missing for me to start my master thesis. Thus I have only two lectures and one language course (polski &#9786;). I have lots of time to write new plugins and recently I've added a few to <a href="../../projects/GameBox" target="_blank">GameBox</a>. Since I am always looking for new things to learn I've started using MySQL and Maven. After almost half a year with only one times sport per week in Oman I can finally visit training in Aachen again. The RWTH has a wide offer of sport activities that I've really missed at other places.

I'am looking forward to an awesome experience in Poland.
