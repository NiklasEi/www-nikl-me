<a href="/traveling/Myanmar/">My trip to Myanmar</a> started approximately one and a half weeks ago and a lot has already happened. Myanmar is a beautiful country and Burmese people are very friendly. They will always smile back at you.

I arrived in Yangon together with a friend and we were joined by his sister in the evening. From the airport we made our way to the hostel by foot and bus which was an interesting experience considering that the buses started operating just the beginning of this year. The next morning we visited the Shwedagon Pagonda and watched the sunrise from there. After two days in Yangon we made a trip to the golden rock and then went up north to Kalaw by bus. From there we started a three day Trekking tour to Inle Lake which was great.

Our trekking-group consisted of seven people plus guide and we had a fun time together. The route led through a bamboo forest and villages from different tribes. The area is pretty hilly and there were awesome views from high places. The two nights during the trip were spend in local homes in small villages and our guide prepared good meals including fruits which he partially cut to look like animals.

I am looking forward to seeing more of the countries nature and its people.
