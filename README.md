Personal website acting as a portfolio and as a playground for new frontend technology. The current iteration is written in Gatsby using Typescript. Predecessors used plain HTML, [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). There also was some playing around with [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola).
