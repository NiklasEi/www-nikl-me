summary: Inventory game inspired by Candy Crush.
---

Connect rows of the same gem (at least 3 of the same kind).

Bombs are spawned when two rows are crossed (T or L shaped). These bombs will fall down like normal gems and explode as soon as there is no other gem falling anymore. Every bomb destroys the gems surrounding it.
