*Submission for Bevy jam 6 with the theme "Chain Reaction".*

A snake game on a match 3 board. Your head triggers matches. Matches will explode and trigger any surrounding matches, creating chain reactions across the game board. If your body gets hit by a triggered match, you loose. Your own tail constantly sorts gems to prime more matches.
