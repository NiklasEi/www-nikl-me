Cinnog uses Leptos with static site generation and islands mode to render a static website with dynamic parts using WebAssembly. As a preparation step, a data layer is constructed using a Bevy ECS World as an in-memory Database.

I wrote an [example project][example-repo] using Cinnog and [deployed it][example-deployed].

The preparation of the data layer currently looks like this in the example project:
```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut data = DataLayer::new();
    data.insert_resource(SiteName("Bevy ECS + Leptos = ðŸ’•".to_owned()));

    data.run(read_ron_files_from_directory::<PersonData>, "people")?;
    data.run(read_markdown_from_directory::<PostFrontMatter>, "blog")?;
    data.run(convert_markdown_to_html, ());

    data.build(App).await
}
```
