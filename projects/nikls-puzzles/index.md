The app currently features 100 levels of Sudoku and 100 Three in a row puzzles. I generated all puzzles myself assuring they have only one solution and can be solved without guessing.

The app can be downloaded from the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nikls-puzzles/id1529182561) and [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.nikl.puzzles) for free. If you have any comments, questions or ideas feel free to contact me.
