Minecraft inventory game inspired by Candy Crush. Connect at least 3 of the same gem to score points.

Crossing two lines of matches (T, L or + shaped) spawns a TNT item. The TNT will fall down like normal gems and explode as soon as there is no other gem falling. When exploding, the TNT destroys all surrounding gems and awards the player with a high number of points.
