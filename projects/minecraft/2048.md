This is an single player inventory game for my plugin <a href="../GameBox/">GameBox</a>.

<a href="https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/" target="_blank">2048</a> is a game of adding up numbers on tiles. The game has a 4x4 grid and every round the player moves all tiles in one direction. In a random free slot a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears after every move. If two tiles slide against each other and they have the same value, they will add up and form a single slide with the combined value. The game is over when there are no free slots left and no move is possible. Until then the game is about reaching the highest score, which is calculated by adding up all values of the tiles in the game.
