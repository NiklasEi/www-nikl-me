GameBox offers a collection of minecraft inventory games. It offers a shared menu containing buttons to all installed games and to a token shop. For administrators, an admin menu can be accessed to install or update games directly out of the GUI.

GameBox supplies a collection of inventory games with a GUI for fast and convenient switching between different games. Token can be won by playing games and can be spend in the fully configurable GUI shop. A flexible set of permissions allows fine grained control over which games a player can play.


For each game, different game modes can be configured. For example there can be a game mode in <a href="../Minesweeper/">Minesweeper</a> called 'easy' with only five mines, a 'normal' mode with eight mines and a 'hard' mode with eleven. All of these modes (and more if you want to) will be available in one single GUI. The configurable settings for each game mode vary from game to game.


For games with two players GameBox automatically includes an invitation GUI for each game mode. A click on the invite button will close the inventory and ask the player to type a name into the chat. All incoming invitations will be displayed in the invitations GUI as skulls of the other player.

## GameBox Permissions {#permissions}




GameBox includes a permission system that is designed to allow for perfect control over the whole plugin and all games. Wildcard permissions allow all players to play all registered games by default.


To restrict access to certain games for certain groups of players one must first take the default wildcard permissions from all players. Then assign the specific permissions using the gameIDs provided in <a href="#ids">the ID table</a>.


<br>
      <table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Permission node</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="permission">gamebox.play.gameID</span></td>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>Permission to play the game given by the gameID. The wildcard permission <span class="permission">gamebox.play.*</span> is given to all players by default and <b>HAS TO BE TAKEN FROM THEM</b> in order to use the game specific permissions.<br><br>
            To get the permission for a specific game, the corresponding gameID has to be used. All gameIDs can be found in <a href="#ids">the ID table</a>.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="permission">gamebox.gamegui.gameID</span></td>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>Permission to open the GUI of the game given by the gameID. The wildcard permission <span class="permission">gamebox.gamegui.*</span> is given to all players by default.<br><br>
            To get the permission for a specific game, the corresponding gameID has to be used. All gameIDs can be found in <a href="#ids">the ID table</a>.</td>

          <tr>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

## GameBox Commands {#commands}



The following list includes all player, shortcut and admin commands that are currently implemented in GameBox. For the shortcut commands players need a shortID for each game. A complete table of the IDs can be found below. For players there is the possibility of using <span class="command">/gb info</span> to get a list of the shortcut commands.


For the moment all admin commands require the same permission <span class="permission">gamebox.admin</span>.

## Unique game IDs {#ids}



Each game has a unique identifier. This ID is called gameID and is used for game specific permissions and in some admin commands. The identifiers are very intuitive, but are never needed by normal players.

## Customization {#customization}



Total configurability is one of the main goals of GameBox. There are several files with options and messages that can be customized.


The configuration file for GameBox is in the plugins folder, as is the token shop configuration and a file containing enabled/disabled information about all known games. The language files for gamebox are in the language folder.


Configuration for single games can be done inside the folder 'GameBox/games/<gameID>'. All language files of a game can be found in 'GameBox/language/<gameID>'.
