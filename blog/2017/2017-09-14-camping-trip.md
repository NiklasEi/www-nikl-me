A week ago I bought a new tent and thought it would be a great idea to test it. I still had two weeks left until heading to Poland, so I went on a cycling trip. After taking the train to Stuttgart, I made my way down the Neckar and then continued along the Rhine. Because of the current weather in South-Germany I quit after five days and visited friends in Darmstadt instead of continuing cycling. The weather got really bad with gusts of up to 60kmph, rain and hail, but other then that camping was nice and I like the tent ^^

I'll do a trip like that again in a warmer month...
