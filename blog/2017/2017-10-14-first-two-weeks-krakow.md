Two weeks ago I arrived in Krakow for my Erasmus semester at the Jagiellonian University. The orientation week planed by ESN Krakow was a great start for the semester. Events like "speed friending" helped with getting to know many of the other Erasmus students. There (of course) where also a lot of parties.

After the orientation week lectures started. There are no experimental physics lectures in english so I am attending the lecture "Data Science" where we use Python for data analyses and two lectures on theoretical physics.
