A colleague of mine has been talking a lot about [the programming language Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){: target="_blank"} and how cool some of its features are. He was convincing enough for me to start looking into it.

Since I have a tradition to learn new languages by writing games, the first resource I checked out was [Are we game yet](https://arewegameyet.rs/){: target="_blank"}, a website dedicated to game development in Rust. From here I started looking for help to get started. They have a list of tutorials, examples, and a curated list of rust game engines. In general, I can very much recommend reading ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/){: target="_blank"} (I am half through at the time of writing this; learned a lot!).

The last few days I've been writing Sokoban following the interesting tutorial at [sokoban.iolivia.me](https://sokoban.iolivia.me/){: target="_blank"}. I continued playing around with the code afterwards and will probably use the Sokoban example to build a different game using the same tools. My final Sokoban code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/NiklasEi/sokoban-rust){: target="_blank"}.
