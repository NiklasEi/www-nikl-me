Recently I joined the 10-day, halloween themed game jam "Scream zone" together with my girlfriend. I myself are not a big fan of horror games, but it was fun trying to write one. Our jam entry is a 2D HTML5 game called "Mummy escape" where the player controls a little mummy that just woke up from its sarcophagus and needs to collect all its organs to flee the pyramid.

We choose Phaser as our game engine, and it worked quite well. For me the biggest pain point was the rather bad typescript support, but as far as I know this is supposed to get much better in the next major version. As a preparation for the jam I did some playing around with example projects and setup a starter-repository for Phaser using typescript and webpack. Configuring hot reload and bundling + minifying of the transpiled JS made development more comfortable.

Today the game jam announced the results of the rating period. We didn't get great ratings, but according to the number of ratings and comments we got I think quite a lot of people liked to play the game. I certainly enjoyed development and am already planning my next game jam participation (this time I'll try using rust).
