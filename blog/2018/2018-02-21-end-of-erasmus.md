My time in Poland is almost over and I just finished my last exam. It was a great time with lots of good memories and new friends. University was harder then I expected, but very interesting. Having lectures about theoretical physics almost three years after my last one in my bachelor was a challenge. But the topics were interesting and I don't regret taking these courses.

Tomorrow my sister will arrive in Krakow, I will move out of my dorms and finish up my Erasmus paper work. For a few days we'll stay in Poland, then drive back to Germany, back home.

In the next few weeks I'll try to find myself a topic for my thesis and a new place to live in Aachen. Wish me luck ^^
