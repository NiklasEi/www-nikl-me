Yesterday was the last day of IronHack and today I am moving out of my room in Amsterdam. The bootcamp was great experience and I learned a lot. The best part was the group itself. We did a lot outside of the bootcamp, met in the park or went to the city after the lessons.

The last week was carrer week. The lessons already ended the week before and many of our group left at that point. For the people who stayed, the last week provided lessons in beeing interviewed, writing your CV, and some actual interviews by companies visiting IronHack.

In the next few weeks I will have interviews with companies, attend several Hackathons, and give up my flat in Aachen.
