A large number of businesses software needs to create documents at some point. Often output of these systems are PDFs that are archived and/or distributed (think invoices or reports).

To offer such document generation, we need to have a form of template that can be filled with data from the database on demand. The template is then rendered with the given data. Common elements are tables that need to be flexible enough to stretch over multiple pages, images, headers and footers.

A common approach is to maintain templates for such documents as HTML.

Better typesetting: LaTeX, Typst (open source compiler)

Wrap rust library for multiple targets (web, C#)
