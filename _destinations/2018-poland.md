  I did an erasmus semester in Krakow at the Jagiellonian University doing theoretical physics (as an experimentalist ^^). At that time Krakow was the biggest city I ever lived in and there was a lot to see and do.

  The semester started in Oktober and I left in February. The mountains around Zakopane (south poland) were awesome!

I stayed in poland for five months from October 2017 to February 2018. Since I didn't have any classes on Fridays, I had plenty of 3-day weekends to travel around the country.

On my first three day trip I went to Zakopane with two friends from my dorms. On the first day we climbed up the Giewont (1894m), but sadly the weather was very bad and there was no view at all due to heavy fog and almost constant rain/snow. The second day had perfect weather and on our way up to the Koscielec we had an awesome views over the whole area (<a href="/tatra">more images of Tatra mountains</a>). We had learned a lesson from the day before and rented Crampons (metal spikes for the shoes). But even with those, we had to decent from the pass (1853m) between Koscielec and Małe Koscielec without taking the summit (2155m), because we didn't have any ice axes.

Another time a few friends took me to Toruń and we had a weekend full of gingerbread and walks through the city.
