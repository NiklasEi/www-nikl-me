As a "stop" in our flight from Singapore back to Germany Sri Lanka was the last country in the post-bachelor asia tour. Starting from Colombo in a rather filthy hostel we made our way through several cities in the matter of two days. After shortly looking around we simply hoped on the next bus and continued looking for a place we liked more. We ended up in Nuwara Eliya, which is a really nice city close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horton_Plains_National_Park" target="_blank">Horton Plains National Park</a>.

I am looking for more pictures atm (I know there are a hundred more ^^). This page will be updated soon!
