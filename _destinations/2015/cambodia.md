short_description:
  Cambodia is a south asian country neighboring Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. It is best known for the ancient city Ankor which probably was the biggest city in the world in around 1200 [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Empire" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>].
  <br><br>
  When visiting Cambodia I concentrated on visiting the UNESCO World Heritage Site Ankor. The site is close to the city Siem Reap in the north of Cambodia. From the capital Phnom Penh it is an interesting bus ride to Siem Reap along a river and the lake Tonle Sap.

They probably won't event try and just put up a new one, what led to this mess in the first place. But it works and the people don't seem to bother ^^

I went to Cambodia as part of my one-month-trip after my bachelor's. Together with my sister and a friend I started off in Phnom Penh and later went north-west to Siem Reap were we mainly visited the Ankor UNESCO World Heritage Site.

For two days we stayed in Phnom Penh and visited temples, museums and other places. Then we took a bus to Siem Reap. For some days we drove around Ankor with bicycles and explored many temples in the area.
