short_description:
  My father was living in Singapore for around three years and I visited him a few times. It was perfect to have a "station" in south asia and I used it as a starting point for traveling.

  From Singapore it's just a bus ride to go to Malaysia. And flights to countries like Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia are quite short.

Singapore offers many activities, parks and huge buildings. I am not a big fan of cities and thus enjoyed the parks the most. I should note that there have been severe problems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asian_haze" target="_blank">haze due to slash-and-burn practices in Indonesia</a>. This Haze can be seen in some of the pictures below and makes the city look way more grey then it normally is.
