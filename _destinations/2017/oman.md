short_description:
  Oman has a very diverse environment. The country is famous for it's wadis, has huge mountain rages, desert and surprisingly green areas in between all of that.

  From my almost five months living in Oman, the most prominent memories regarding the country are the nights spend on the beach and numerous trips to wadis. I still remember staring at the stars and at the glowing ocean (bioluminescencent algae) for hours before falling asleep.

    label: At an omani wedding (day 2). The image shows a part of a large tent in which the families of the new married couple formally eat together for the first time. We were invited to this gathering the day before, while we were at the groom's traditional celebration. The day before the tent was used for the bride's party (which tends to be a lot more westerly then the grooms's).

    label: View from half the way up to the spring above Wakan village. It is a very nice path that leads up to the spring through green gardens and perfect view points looking far into the valley.
