short_description:
  During my internship in <a href="/traveling/Oman">Oman</a> I went to Iran for my christmas holidays.
  <br><br>
  Iran is a very interesting country with many places to visit. Sadly there was only time for the south.

  FYI<span>:</span> the Kabab is superb ;)

    label: Khaiele (community houses for regular prayers) and water reservoirs close to a Zoroastrian graveyard. In the background on top of the two hills there are Towers of Silence (Dakhma) which were used in the past to dispose of bodies. To not pollute fire (through cremation) or ground water (through burials), Zoroastrians used to let birds eat the flesh of the dead in those towers. The bones where then collected in a small well in the middle of the tower, where they disintegrated to powder (sometimes with the help of some acid)[<a href="http://heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/death/page3.htm" target="_blank">more info</a>]. These towers are now out of use due to laws by the iranian government. They are open for tourists.

I went together with two friends from GUtech and one of them had connections to a family in Teheran. The father of said family spoke (almost) no english, but he ended up travelling together with us and showing us around a few cities in the south. It was very good having a local with us and the whole family was welcoming and generous helping us and offering food and loges in Teheran.

One night we stayed at the grandfathers home in Ardakan, which is a town close to Yazd. He lives quite rural in a clay house. It was the most adventurous christmas eve in my life (up to now ^^).
