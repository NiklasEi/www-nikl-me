short_description:
  Kyrgyzstans biggest neighbors are Kazakhstan in the north and China in the east-south. The country is dominated by mountainous terrain and by its biggest lake Issyk-Kul in the north-east which is enclosed by high mountain ranges.

  For two weeks I traveled through the area around the Issyk-Kul together with a friend. We took a bus from the capital Bishkek and generally went around the lake clockwise.

    label: We had to improvise a bit in order to keep the gas warm enough. At our highest camping site we weren't able to cook and at a bit lower sites constructions like this were necessary to keep the gas coming.

Together with a friend I made a ~2 weeks trip through east Kyrgyzstan shortly before moving to <a href="/traveling/Oman/">Oman</a>.

One of the best parts was a 5 day trip to a glacier. It was my first trip with a tent through mountains and it was great. For following trips we made a list of things we forgot to take. That list has quite some entries now ^^
