short_description:
  In the middle of my Erasmus semester in Poland, I went back to Germany for Christmas. For ten days around new Year I made a road trip through France with a friend.

  There were some hikes in the southern alps, a new years firework in Monaco and a lot of cold nights in the car ^^

    label: At the end point of the hike. At the top of that mountain was an old military station, complete with two bunkers and some caved in houses. You can see the "real" alps in the background.
