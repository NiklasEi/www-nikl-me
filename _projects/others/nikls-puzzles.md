title: Nikl's Puzzles
summary: Android and iOS app with logic puzzles. Written in Dart using Flutter. The App is currently in internal testing and will be published soon&trade;.
---

The app currently features 100 levels of Sudoku and 200 Three in a row puzzles. I generated all puzzles myself. They all have only one solution and can be solved without guessing.

The plan is to publish the App on the App Store and Play Store for free.

If you are interested in beta testing, drop me a mail, so I can add you to the test program :)
