summary: Android and iOS app with logic puzzles. Written in Dart using Flutter. The App is currently in internal testing and will be published soon&trade;.

The app currently features 100 levels of Sudoku and 100 Three in a row puzzles. I generated all puzzles myself assuring they have only one solution and can be solved without guessing.

The app can be downloaded from the App store and Play store for free. If you have any comments, questions or ideas feel free to contact me.
