summary: Two player GameBox game. Sink your opponent's ships before he sinks yours.
---

Each player has two different grids:
1. his/her own grid where all ships are set and the shots of the opponent are marked (misses and hits)
2. the opponents grid where only the slots are visible the player shot at already

During the first part of the game the players will set their ships. Afterwards the player that send the invite will start shooting. Both players will take turn at firing at a slot on the opponents grid. If it is a hit, the shooter gets another try, otherwise the second player can shoot.

Winner is the first player to hit all parts of all enemy ships.
