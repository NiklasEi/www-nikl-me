This website is a project of mine. I wanted to learn a bit of html and wanted to know how to build a website in general. It is a static website.

For building I am using <a href="https://www.getlektor.com" target="_blank">Lektor</a> and the website is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. Lector and the hosting are free. The only thing I have to pay is my domain which is just around one Euro per month.

Out of interest I got myself a free TLS certificate (you should see that at your URL which starts with http<b>s</b>) with <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>. For a few months my page was on GitLab pages which is an awesome offer by GitLab. But I was missing an automated redirect from http to https. This is one of the reasons for why I eventually decided to try out Netlify and then stuck with it.
